### Hey peeps! :relaxed:

 I'm Aris Ernst Tabaque, an aspiring artist :pencil2::art:. I do portrait drawings using charcoal, graphite and colored pencils. I like to eat and stay up all night watching series and movies. I'm currently a student of West Visayas State University :school: taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Major in Multimedia. I want to travel the World :earth_americas::airplane: because I want to see the different places and culture of different countries. 

 I'm always trying to learn new things to help me grow. And I believe that life is a series of misfortune and mystery that serves as a catalyst for growth. What you know determines every experience you'll have in life. :ok_hand::ok_hand:
